Matlab code for holographic photostimulation and volumetric imaging.

Use "MainControl.m" for holographic photostimulation system (see instruction in the opening section of the file).
Use "ETLControl.m" for volumetric imaging (see instruction in the opening section of the file).

The "PhotostimulationArtifactRemover" folder contains codes to remove/suppress the photostimulation artifacts imposed by the photostimulation laser on the recorded movies.
