Matlab code for holographic photostimulation and volumetric imaging.

Use "MainControl.m" for holographic photostimulation system (see instruction in the opening section of the file).
Use "ETLControl.m" for volumetric imaging (see instruction in the opening section of the file).

Detailed instruction on how to use the code will be updated.
